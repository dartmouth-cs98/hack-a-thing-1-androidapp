## Build and export a simple android VR app to my Galaxy S8

The goal is to familiarize myself with building VR apps for my android phone to view in my Gear VR, including learning how to use Unity and Android Studio. I ended up building the roll-a-ball application in Unity and setting it up with VR features. The majority of time spent was trying to learn all the boilerplating for developing Unity applications, setting up Android Studio to work with Unity, and learning introductory C#. I was mostly frustrated with the lack of up-to-date documentation that led me down a deprecated unity tutorial that ended up with me having to redo most of the tutorial after finding out that there was a newer version. In the end, I got most of what I wanted except configuring the Gear VR controller correctly (which has very little documentation, most of which is quite confusing).
